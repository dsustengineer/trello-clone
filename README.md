## Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode, and the adhoc server on `http://localhost:4000` using `concurrently`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, if not already launched.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Credits

Inspired by Imanov and Bespoyav's [FullStack React with TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/Fullstack-React-TypeScript-Patterns-Testing-ebook/dp/B08K8KFTL1). Good book, purchase a copy to support authors!

P.S.

I had to piece the broken parts (fix imports, small styled-components change, update npm packages to support React 18) in order to make this work as it should. See reviews on Amazon. So you can fork/clone this repo for a working version. Cheers!
